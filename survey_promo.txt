*The Angsana Network*

Hi fellow alumni!

We hope you have all been doing well :) It's been a long while since we've seen each other, and we sure do miss everybody! Adult life has been hard and so busy, and our CAPT days seem to be so far behind us. Wouldn't it be great to meet each other again and to catch up, and perhaps even continue to grow and do life together once again?

This is why we're setting up The Angsana Network! The Angsana Network is a alumni-run community/network that seeks to foster opportunities for alumni to stay in touch with each other, and to allow CAPT alumni to feel better engaged, even in the face of busy adulthood. We hope to provide opportunities to meet and hold gatherings, to do things together, to walk with each other through difficult life and career journeys, and just to hang out or lepak with old friends!

This network is all about us - the alumni! Thus, we need your help to fill in this short survey that will take up 5-10 minutes of your time, so that we can best understand what the alumni would like to see be a part of this new network.

We'll always be CAPTains, no matter where we are in life ðŸ˜Š Thank you for your responses and we hope to see you soon in the very first Angsana Network event!
